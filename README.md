# Advanced Blockchain AG code challenge

  ## Installation 
You will need to have Node.js installed to run this application.  Type the below command into the terminal to check if you already have node installed;
```
$node -v
```
If you already have node installed it will tell you which version (e.g. v8.4.0).  If you need to install Node.js please follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install all the dependencies please enter the following command into the terminal once you have navigated into the root directory; 
```
$npm install
```

The easiest way to view the app is by downloading the [Expo client app](https://expo.io/) on your iPhone or Android device and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.
Then enter the following command in the terminal to start the app;
```
$npm start
```
Once you've run the above command on your terminal you will see a QR code.  You can scan this code using the Expo app (Android) or the Camera app (iOS) to view the app.

Alternatively, if you already have a simulator or virtual device installed you can launch the app on an Android Virtual Device by running the following command;
```
$npm run android
```
or this command if you are running an iOS Simulator;
```
$npm run ios
```
